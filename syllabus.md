# Overview

This is both an applied statistics and a technical communications course, and is intended for second year students in the Applied Statistics and Data Science master's programs. Students taking this course should already have completed master's level courses in probability, theoretical statistics, regression analysis, and multivariate statistics.

The goals of the course are as follows:

- Provide experience conducting data analyses through case studies drawn from multiple domains.
- Provide multiple opportunities to write about statistical findings and receive feedback.
- Provide exposure to new statistical methods and theoretical concepts.
- Provide hands-on experience working with data and implementing analyses.


# Grading


|   Component   |     Weight     |
|:-------------:|:--------------:|
|  Reports      | 70% (10% each) |
|  Participation  |      10%       |
|  Presentation |      20%       |




## Coursework

The coursework will entirely take the form of individual writing
assignments. There will be approximately 7 writing assignments, one for
each case study.  Each writing assignment will be 2-3 pages in length
and will resemble a memo prepared by a professional data analyst,
summarizing methods and findings from a data analysis.

Each writing assignment will address a writing prompt provided by
the instructor.  You will have significant latitude in your approach,
but the analyses are not completely open-ended -- you should focus on
addressing the issues raised in the writing prompt and in most cases
you will be asked to use a specific analytic approach in your analysis.

Writing for this course is relatively short and focused.  The text
component of a report should generally be 2-3 pages in length, with 3
pages being a hard limit.  Two pages is sufficient and you should only
exceed two pages if it is absolutely necessary.  Graphs and tables do not count toward the
page limit, and you should only include graphs and tables that directly
contribute to your main claims.

There are no exams or quizzes in this course.

## Late submission policy
Late submissions are not accepted for any reason. If you feel you should be excused from turning in an assignment due to a medical or family emergency, notify the instructor by submitting a [report of illness and absence](https://webapps.lsa.umich.edu/SAA/UGStuAdv/App/Illness/RptIll.aspx). 


## Presentation
Twenty percent of your grade is on your presentations in the class.  The presentations will occur towards the second half of the semester.    Presentations should be well prepared and polished as what you would prepare for presenting to your supervisor in the industry.


## Grading

Each writing assignment will be scored according to
the following rubric:

* Focus (25 points): Does the report primarily contain analysis
and interpretation of results?  Is the report focused on a single
clearly-stated question? Is the analysis goal clearly and explicitly
stated and motivated?

* Methods/approach (25 points): Is the analytic approach appropriate?
Are analytic decisions justified based on established properties of
the methods?  Are all analysis methods adequately documented so that
the analysis can be reproduced?

* Writing/organization (25 points): Is the writing well-organized and
straightforward to read?  Is statistical terminology used appropriately
and defined where appropriate? Does the report have an informative title?

* Findings/interpretation (25 points): Does the analysis provide
insight related to the primary motivating question?  Are the conclusions
stated explicitly and supported by the analysis and reported results?

## Some major themes of this course are:

* Formulating meaningful and tractable questions based on
  research goals

* Devising, documenting, and implementing analysis strategies

* Communicating findings

* Leveraging knowledge of statistical foundations and theory when
  engaging in applied research

* Understanding the capabilities and limitations of statistical
  methods

* Understanding the value and limitations of different types of data

* Interpretation of analytic results

* Developing data manipulation and computing skills, especially for
  large and complex data sets

* Building knowledge about several applied research areas where
  data collection and analysis plays a major role
  
## Expectations for student writing

All statisticians must frequently communicate and document their findings
in written form.  Writing about your analytic plans and research findings
is an excellent way to organize your thoughts, strengthen your arguments,
and identify weaknesses in your claims.

The memos written in this course reflect the type of writing routinely
done by data analysts in many business and academic settings.  These are
short, focused writing assignments and are intended to document a data analysis.
The writing should be concise and rich in specific content.  All of the
writing should focus on communicating specific scientific insights --
these are not essays written for general audiences.

Your writing should focus on a specific question, and should exclusively present
analysis and findings that address that question.  You generally should
provide one short paragraph motivating the research question, and this
motivating paragraph may be somewhat less technical than the remainder of the memo.
Apart from this brief introduction, your writing should exclusively focus on analysis
and findings.

For the writing assignments in this course, you should imagine that
you are writing a memo to be read by colleagues or collaborators.
Your audience consists of people familiar with the data and scientific
or industrial context behind the data, and who are also knowledgeable
about statistics at your own level.

Below are some guidelines for writing in this course.  These are a few
of the most important things to keep in mind.  We will expand on this
a lot during the semester.

* Write in an appropriate academic or business tone.  Do not write
  casually, but also avoid excessively formal language.

* Organize your content so that your writing has a focused message,
  with each paragraph contributing a specific and distinct point to this
  message.

* Each report should focus on one primary question.

* Motivate your analytic approaches in terms of fundamental ideas from
  statistics.

* Use simple, direct language.  Avoid convoluted expressions, hidden
  or needlessly subtle meanings, unusual vocabulary, and digressions
  that do not contribute to your main message.

* Express your arguments in as plain and simple terms as is practical.
  Do not write in a way that requires the reader to re-read your writing
  multiple times to understand your point.  Favor short sentences in the
  active voice with one clause, and paragraphs that focus on one topic
  and that do not extend for more than 5-6 sentences.

* Write for an audience that may include non-native English speakers.
  Avoid colloquialisms and obscure cultural references or metaphors.

* You are expected to be able to write in grammatically-correct
  English.  It is understood that there are many non-native English
  speakers in the course, and occasional minor grammatical issues will
  be overlooked.

# Academic Honesty

You are expected to abide by academic honesty standards set forth by the department and the graduate school. In particular, there is a **zero-tolerance** policy towards plagiarism of any form. Writing assignments will be checked against each other, as well as against a large database of submissions from past semesters, for plagiarism. Essays which are found to be plagiarized will receive a score of zero. Repeat offences will result in a failing grade and dismissal from the course.

## ChatGPT policy
It is okay to use ChatGPT/GenAI to improve your writing. It is _not_ okay to use ChatGPT to write  entire assignments for you. Keep in mind that part of your grade for each report is based on originality. It will be up to peer reviewers, GSI, and instructor to assess this based on how much of your submission was generated using AI (or copied from other online sources).
